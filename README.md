# iris_machine_learning
a mini project on iris dataset, choosing the best machine learning model

Project Overview:
	This is a classification project for the Iris species. Iris is a flower with three different species https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set 

Objectives:
•	Try to find the best machine learning model to categorise the species of a flower into three categories
•	Find the best parametres on this model.
•	Generate random values for are features and give them to our model to categorize this "random" flowers into the categories.

#Running the Notebook in Google Colab
  1.	Open Google Colab: Go to https://colab.research.google.com/.
  2.	Upload the Notebook:
  3.	Click on "File" -> "Upload notebook" and select "Project_Capstone.ipynb" from your local machine.
  4.	Alternatively, you can upload the entire project directory (including "Project_Capstone.ipynb") to your Google Drive and open the notebook directly from there.

#Methods Used

    •	Data Manipulation (pandas,numpy)
    •	Data Visualization(seaborn,matplotlib)
    •	Machine Learning(Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, K-Neihgbors Classifier)


#DATA
  •	iris is a seaborn preloaded dataset
