# iris_machine_learning
a mini project on iris dataset, choosing the best machine learning model

PROJECT  IRIS MACHINE LEARNING

Objectives:

a)In this analysis, we'll try to find the best machine learning model to categorise the species of a flower into three categories

b)Additionally, we'll find the best parametres on this model.

c)Finally, we'll generate random values for are features and give them to our model to categorize this "random" flowers into the categories.
